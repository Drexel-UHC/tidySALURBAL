The **tidySALURBAL** package has two goals: 1) to provide utility functions for the common SALURBAL data cleaning tasks and 2) to allow users to interface with the SALURBAL data API to return tidyverse-ready data frames, optionally with feature geometry included.

## Installation

You can install the development version of tidySALURBAL from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Drexel-UHC/tidySALURBAL")
```
To load the package call the following code.

```{r example}
library(tidySALURBAL)
```

After you have loaded the package you can start using some of the utlity functions provided. Here are two useful ones. 

## sanitize_codebook_var()

  `sanitize_codebook_var()` converts existing SALURBAL data identifiers to FAIR variables aka `var_name`. In the example below we start with the salurbal data identifier of `APSPM25MEANL1AD` which contains some geographic information, we then use sanitize_codebook_var() to convert it to a purely variable identifier.


```{r}
sanitize_codebook_var('APSPM25MEANL1AD')
```



## get_uhc_file_path()

For this project we will use the UHC server as our data storage location. This function just helps generates paths that R can utilize. This is utilized in our setup chunks. 

```{r}
get_uhc_file_path(dataset_id = "APSL1AD", file = "APSL1AD_06132022.csv")
```
